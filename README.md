# React Form made with React-Bootstrap
Just a simple form that connects to two other version depending on what information you would like to fill in focused around the game Apex Legends (just gave me an idea on what to use as text fields and etc.).

## Still in development but you can check it out if you install it
- npm install after downloading directory
- then npm run start to test it out
